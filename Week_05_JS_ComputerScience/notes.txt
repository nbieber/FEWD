$("#faq").css('color');

// Setter - sets information
$("#faq").css('color', 'red');

"the set of matched elements." - the stuff you get from the selector

// Debugging

1. CHECK YOUR CONSOLE!!!!
2. Try some breakpoints
    - put a breakpoint in the function you're trying to call
       - does it get called?
3. try running your selectors by themselves in the console
